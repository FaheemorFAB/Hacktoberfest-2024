<h1 align="center"> Hacktoberfest-2024 </h1>

This repo is a beginner friendly repo where you can make your first `OPEN SOURCE` contribution.

I have seen many people struggle to contribute because of wide variety of tech stack used by the developers so I thought of doing this little experiment , Here in this repository you don't have any specific tech stack, you can use any tech stack that you are comfortable with, you can push your portfolio, a cool component , a landing page that you made in a hackathon , it can be anything, if you are not a coder just push a cool picture of your pets, nature , laptop setup what ever you can . The ultimate goal of this repo is to get people started their open source contributions and get their four PRs merged before hacktoberfest ends. 

# Note

This repository is particularly for the beginners so give them a chance to get started , if you know someone who is beginner and wanted to get started you can share this to them.
